# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/ArsalanAnwer0/Dominoes-Game.git
cd Dominoes-Game/Dominoes-Game

# Open in browser
open Dominoes.html
# Or double-click the file
```

### Option 2: Run with Docker

# Build and run with Docker Compose
docker-compose up

# Or build manually
docker build -t dominoes-game .
docker run -p 8081:8080 dominoes-game

# Open browser
open http://localhost:8081
```

### Option 3: Console Version

```bash
# Navigate to console version
cd console-version

# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run the game
node dominoes-game.js

# Run tests
node test-game.js
```

### Option 4: AWS S3 Deployment

See [Deployment Guide](#deployment) below.

## Game Rules

### Setup
- **28 Domino Tiles:** 0-0 through 6-6
- **Each Player:** 10 tiles
- **Boneyard:** 8 remaining tiles

### How to Play

1. **Starting:** Random player begins by playing any tile
2. **Playing:**
   - Match one half of your tile to the chain's head (left) or tail (right)
   - Click on highlighted red tiles to play
   - Choose placement if both ends match
3. **Drawing:**
   - Click "Draw from Boneyard" if you can't play
   - Draw until you get a playable tile or boneyard is empty
   - Pass if boneyard is empty and no playable tile
4. **Winning a Round:**
   - Empty your hand first, OR
   - Have lowest pip count if game is blocked

### Scoring

- **Points Mode:** Score equals opponent's remaining pip count
- **Wins Mode:** Track number of rounds won
- **Game Winner:** First to reach target score (default: 100)

### Game Modes

**2 Players:**
- Hot-seat play on same device
- Active player sees their tiles
- Opponent's tiles shown face-down

**vs Computer:**
- You're Player 1
- AI automatically plays as Player 2
- Basic AI strategy implemented

## Deployment

### Docker Deployment

**Build Image:**
```bash
docker build -t dominoes-game:v1.0.0 .
```

**Run Container:**
```bash
docker run -d -p 8081:8080 --name dominoes dominoes-game:v1.0.0
```

**Using Docker Compose:**
```bash
# Start
docker-compose up -d

# View logs
docker-compose logs -f

# Stop
docker-compose down
```

**Docker Features:**
- Nginx web server
- Health check endpoint
- Automatic restart policy
- Port mapping: 8081 (host) → 8080 (container)

### AWS S3 Static Website Deployment

**Prerequisites:**
```bash
# Configure AWS credentials
aws configure

# Or set environment variables
export AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID="your-access-key"
export AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY="your-secret-key"
export AWS_DEFAULT_REGION="us-east-1"
```

**Deployment Steps:**

```bash
# Navigate to terraform directory
cd terraform

# Initialize Terraform
terraform init

# Review deployment plan
terraform plan

# Deploy to AWS
terraform apply

# Get website URL
terraform output website_endpoint
```

**Customization:**

Create a `terraform.tfvars` file:
```hcl
bucket_name  = "my-dominoes-game"
aws_region   = "us-east-1"
environment  = "prod"
```

Or use command-line variables:
```bash
terraform apply -var="bucket_name=my-dominoes-game" -var="environment=prod"
```

**Updating the Website:**
```bash
# Make changes to game files
# Then reapply Terraform
terraform apply
# Terraform will detect file changes via MD5 hash and update only modified files
```

**Destroying Resources:**
```bash
terraform destroy
```

**Cost Estimate:**
- Storage: ~$0.023 per GB per month
- Data transfer: First 1GB free, then $0.09 per GB
- Requests: $0.0004 per 1,000 GET requests
- Expected: Under $1/month for moderate traffic

**Automated Deployment:**

Use the provided deployment script:
```bash
cd terraform
chmod +x deploy.sh
./deploy.sh
```

## Troubleshooting

### Docker Issues

**Problem:** Port already in use
```bash
# Solution: Use different port
docker run -p 8082:8080 dominoes-game
```

**Problem:** Container won't start
```bash
# Solution: Check logs
docker-compose logs
```

### AWS Deployment Issues

**Problem:** Bucket name already exists
```bash
# Solution: Use unique bucket name in terraform.tfvars
bucket_name = "my-unique-dominoes-game-123"
```

**Problem:** Access denied
```bash
# Solution: Check AWS credentials and permissions
aws sts get-caller-identity
```

### Game Issues

**Problem:** Tiles not displaying
```bash
# Solution: Clear browser cache and reload
Cmd/Ctrl + Shift + R
```

**Problem:** AI not responding
```bash
# Solution: Check browser console for errors
Open DevTools → Console tab
```
